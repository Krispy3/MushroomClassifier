# MushroomClassifier
Mushroom classification using logistic regression

## Business Understanding
Determining the edibility of mushrooms is of crucial importance in the field. Our field guide uses a data science approach to determine the edibility of any given mushroom within the 190 species provided in the supplementary dataset. This model can take the physical traits of an unknown mushroom and classify it as edible or poisonous

## Data Understanding
The data used for training and testing is a synthetic dataset generated expressly for the purpose of machine learning classification. The data was generated from the secondary dataset of 190 real mushroom species, meaning all entries in the testing set are properly labeled and correspond to a known species. For this reason, we expect the classification scores to be very high, provided we find the best model.
